## Task Overview

Imagine we are assigned to monitor some user's building lists, each user has his building list which is different from other users. and we have the privileges to create, update or delete buildings in user's data ( as admins ).

Our task is to create a simple interface to show a dropdown of users and a building list to show user's building lists.Each building have a MapView which shows the location of building on map with Marker.

## Acceptance Criteria
